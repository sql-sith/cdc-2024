# Cedar Rapids Area Homeschools

## IT Club Cyber Defense, 2023-2024 season

This repository will hold meeting notes, source code, and anything else that seems valuable that seems like it fits better in here than in Zulip, or that we want to persist beyond Zulip's 10,000-post history.

## Resources

In addition to this GitHub site, we will be using a few other resources this year. 

### Zulip

- [Zulip](https://cyberdefense.zulipchat.com) is a chat and collaboration platform. It's a lot like **Slack** (which we used last year).

  It is structured around "streams," which are like channels in other apps. However, when you start a new message in a stream, you give it a topic, and people reply to that topic.

  The benefit of this is that instead of having an unmanageable mess of unread threads, each thread is named so you can distinguish them more easily and know which threads (topics) you want to stay caught up on. You will be sent an invitation to sign up for our **Zulip** server.

### Discord

- [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/843907386556416081/1136022052558614679) is, um, another chat platform. While **Zulip** will be a private platform for our team only, Iowa State will make a Discord Server available where you can talk to **Innovate IT** staff and other students for help or for any other reason.

### ISERink

- [ISERink](https://iseage2.iseage.org) is a Virtual Machine platform (running VMWare VSphere) that Iowa State makes available for teams to use. It's basically the Internet in a bottle.

### Zoom

- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download) will be used for video conferencing. This will allow us to share our screens with each other. It will also let and you to see the currently-shared screen (usually mine) on a wall display while keeping your own workspace front and center on your own computer. This means you won't have to keep switching back and forth between the two. Finally, of you are unable to attend in person but have time to attend remotely, you'll be able to do that with zoom also.

### YouTube

- [Our YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@cyberdefenseclub) will have videos of some of our meetings plus an occasional bonus video, usually considering of me successfully completing a previously failed demonstration. I used to cut out some of the mistakes and dread air but that takes a long time. Since then, we've agreed that it's better to just get the recordings out there in their butt-ugly glory so that YouTube can create a transcript, because you can search the transcript and use it to jump to the part of the video you want.

## Personal Vibe Diary

I am a little disappointed that the meeting I made a full soundtrack for was snubbed when Oscar nominations rolled around. The outro sequence was possibly the best thing in the history of things. 

In a fit of protest, I've used the silent film genre for a more recent bonus video, but without the typical accompanying soundtrack. Take that, AMPAS.
