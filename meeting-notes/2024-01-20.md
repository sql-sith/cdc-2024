## With the homework, we aren't tracking to win

- This is where we are and this is our decision
- This is the way the world works

...so we are being trained to be a versitile, problem solving team.


team: `|         |`  
you:  `    | |    `

Winning the competition DEPENDS ON US!

## Powershell

- We want it to work as a CLI app instead of as an interactive app.
- First, we define a function.
- The function is defined in the script, not the shell.
    - `.\GetFileList.ps1` --> create subshell --> creates function --> exit subshell --> function is now out of scope :(
- So we run `. .\GetFileList.ps1`
    - `.\GetFileList.ps1` --> creates function --> script ends --> the function is not out of scope :)
    - `.` is the same as the linux `source` command
    - or as `export`ing a variable
    - `.` means "do it here".
- `$_` means "the object we're working with"
- docstrings are written with:
    ```ps1
    <#
        Docstring goes here
    #>
    ```
