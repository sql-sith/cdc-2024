# Encryption

### Preface

Before we start, we assume Alice wants to communicate a message with Bob.
We also assume that Eve wants to know what they are communicating and hears everything Alice and Bob tell each other.
Alice and Bob would prefer that Eve does not hear what they are communicating. (maybe they are planning a surprise party)


### The method we are learning about

1) Pick $g$ (which is called the generator) and $p$ (which is called the prime number)
	- Both large primes
	- Alice, Bob, and Eve see this
2) Alice picks $P_{rivateA}$
	- must be at least 5 digits
	- only Alice knows this
3) Bob picks $P_{rivateB}$
	- must be at least 5 digits
	- only Bob knows this
4) Alice calculates $P_{ublicA} = g^{P_{rivateA}} \mod {p}$
	- Alice, Bob, and Eve see this
5) Bob calculates $P_{ublicB} = g^{P_{rivateB}} \mod {p}$
	- Alice, Bob, and Eve see this
6) Calculate

		- Apparently, something here meant to floor the value because we want an integer and $\pi$ is irrational.
		- TeX is very interesting

# remarks

- Python `mpz` is a big number. Duck typing says it's an `int`.
- `import`ing a module `as __main__`
