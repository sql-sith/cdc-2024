## Housekeeping

Next Saturday, I am going to New Mexico to see the annular eclipse. Dan, can you come up with something (whump whump)?

## Fun homework for last week

What did you think about the Pentagon's change of heart toward the public hacking community?

What was your impression of Mitre's ATT&CK Matrix?

## Fun homework for this week

Build a VM on ICERINK.

- Whenever you build an ICERINK VM, please prefix it with your name, initials, or hacker name.
  - If you use a hacker name, please keep the same one for the season, or let us know if you are changing. We are a team and need to minimize confusion. Limit two hacker names per customer per customer per season.
- Get the networking to work, at least enough to do the following.
- Install some you want to install.
  - Start simple if you want to (SSH, lynx) or shoot for the moon (webmail, Wikimedia). Go with something you are personally interested in, if you're the kind of person who has personal interests.
- Come back next week and report on your fun and success!
  - Or other ventures.

## Fun homework whenever you want to do it

- The OWASP Juice Shop
  - We should build a Juice Shop instance in ISERINK so that it's easier for Joshua to use. His laptop might have trouble running a local instance of the app.
